## PriceGemini 💎🔮✨

PriceGemini is a machine learning project to predict the price of diamonds, using a variety of features including carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. The project uses an XGBoost model to achieve an R-squared score of 0.93 on the test set, which means that it can explain 93% of the variation in the target variable.

### How to Use

To use PriceGemini, simply provide the model with the following features:

* Carat ⚖️
* Cut 🔪
* Color 🎨
* Clarity 💎
* Depth 📐
* Table 📊
* X dimension 📏
* Y dimension 📏
* Z dimension 📏

The model will then output a prediction for the price of the diamond 💰

# Benefits

PriceGemini can be used to benefit a variety of stakeholders, including:

* Diamond buyers 💎💍🛍️: PriceGemini can help diamond buyers to make more informed decisions about their purchases.
* Diamond sellers 💎💎💎: PriceGemini can help diamond sellers to set more competitive prices.
* Insurance companies 🛡️: PriceGemini can help insurance companies to more accurately value diamonds.

### Future Work

* Collect and use more data, especially data on higher-priced diamonds.
* Explore other machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning techniques.
* Develop a web application or mobile app that allows users to predict the price of diamonds using the model.
