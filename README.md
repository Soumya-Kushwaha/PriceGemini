# Diamond Price Predictor ðŸ’Ž

A machine learning project to predict diamond prices based on various characteristics using multiple regression models.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a diamond dataset to predict prices based on features like carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and physical dimensions. It implements several machine learning models including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression to find the best price prediction model.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:
- `carat`: Weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)
- `cut`: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- `color`: Diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best)
- `clarity`: Clarity grade (I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF)
- `depth`: Height from culet to table (54-70)
- `table`: Width of top facet relative to widest point (50-73)
- `x`: Length (mm)
- `y`: Width (mm)
- `z`: Depth (mm)
- `price`: Price in USD (target variable)
